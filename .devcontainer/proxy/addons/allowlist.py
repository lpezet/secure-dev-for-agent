"""Domain allowlist for proxy egress control.

Reads /etc/agent-allowlist (bind-mounted from the host) to restrict which
external destinations the proxy will forward to. One domain per line; lines
starting with # and blank lines are ignored.

If the file is absent or unreadable, all destinations are permitted and a
warning is logged at startup. Restart the proxy after editing the file to
pick up changes.

Internal host blocking (broker, cred-gateway) is handled by policy.py, which
runs before this addon.
